	<p> Hello. My name is Amanda Farmer and I am 21 years old. I was born on Saturday, December 12, at Highland 

Community Hospital (formerly Crosby Memorial Hospital) to the parents of Huiel and Debbie Farmer. My brother, 

Brandon, is 18 years old and is a Senior at Pearl River Central High School.  During my time at Pearl River Central 

High School I was on the Blue Angels Dance Team and a member of the Lady Devils Softball Team. I graduated with 

Honors in May 2006. </p>

	<p> After graduation, I decided to attend Pearl River Community College and  major in Computer Networking 

Technology, Computer Programming Technology, and Web Development Technology. After two semesters, I got the 

opportunity to live and work in Disney World via the College Program through Pearl River community College. In 

August 2007, I left for Disney World. I spent almost six months living and working in Disney. While in Disney, I 

lived at Vista Way Apartments and had five awesome roommates. I worked at All * Star Movies in the food court as a 

food preparer and a cashier. Sometimes after work my roommates, co-workers, and I would all spend the rest of the 

evening in one of the four Disney Parks. This is one of the greatest experiences of my life, and I would recommend 

any one to try this Program. </p>

	<p> I returned to Pearl River Community College after finishing the College Program. I am currently a member 

of Phi Theta Kappa and on the Dean's List. I will graduate from Pearl River Community College in December 2010. 

After graduation I plan to attend the University of Southern Mississippi in hope to obtain a degree in Computer 

Science. </p>
